## 5th Dimension

There is a problem in the ticket market that, for example, tickets are not always granted authenticity, which sometimes allows fraudsters to sell fake tickets to some people. For this, we would like to develop a web application that provides event providers with a ticketing system based on blockchain (Ethereum).

Within the web application, tickets are generated and stored in the form of NFTs. End users can create a profile on our website, which they can then use to purchase tickets from the companies and artists that cooperate with us. On our website, users can view and sell their tickets through a wallet function. This allows us to ensure that tickets are unique and can be uniquely attributed. We also enable a secure exchange of event tickets between different users.
